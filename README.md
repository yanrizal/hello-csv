## Hello CSV

The backlog is as folows:

0. Read the file (sample.csv).
1. Parse the loaded csv.
2. For each line do transfomation for `first_name` and `last_name` into `full_name`, hence we'll have `full_name` for each line.
3. Send the transformed line via SMS. (see [helper.js](https://github.com/HOOQsters/hello-csv/blob/master/helper.js)) 
4. Log the SMS sending status result to S3. (see [helper.js](https://github.com/HOOQsters/hello-csv/blob/master/helper.js))

### Discussion

- What do you think about the [`naive()`](https://github.com/HOOQsters/hello-csv/blob/master/parse-callback.js#L11) function?
- naive function is using callback which is you make it work, but it's ugly because you'll make long code pyramid tree, but we can do it cleaner and much more stable code using async and promise
- Please take a peek at the [parse-async.js](https://github.com/HOOQsters/hello-csv/blob/master/parse-async.js), [parse-stream.js](https://github.com/HOOQsters/hello-csv/blob/master/parse-stream.js) and [parse-promise.js](https://github.com/HOOQsters/hello-csv/blob/master/parse-promise.js), then give your best gift to us! (Yes, sending us a [proper PR](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/))

**Constraint**: Please use async API only e.g. `fs.readFile` **NOT** `fs.readFileSync` for reading files.

**Note**: The [`sendSms`](https://github.com/HOOQsters/hello-csv/blob/master/helper.js#L17) and [`logToS3`](https://github.com/HOOQsters/hello-csv/blob/master/helper.js#L29) have surprises, please deal with that.

Ah, yes, one last thing, please use http://jscs.info/ to make your code consistent.

Have fun!
